# Experimental-Data
Experimental data collected for paper "Fault Type and Location Influence Measuring Test Suite Effectiveness"

Folder : Assertions vs. detectable mutants matrix.
Description : This folder contains the Assertions vs. detectable mutants matrices which are used to conduct experiments in RQ 2&3.

Folder : Test Suite Effectiveness by Controlling on Assertion Type
Description : This folder contains a bunch of text files. Each text file contains a list of mutation score of the randomly composed test suites. Subject program and assertion type of the test suites are mentioned in the file names. Folder "Sample Test Suite" contains a sample randomly composed test suite for JFreeChart with 50 randomly selected assertTrue/False().
