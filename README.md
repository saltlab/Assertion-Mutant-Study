# Assertion Mutant Study
Experimental data collected for paper "Fault Type and Location Influence Measuring Test Suite Effectiveness"

Folder : Matrices
-- This folder contains the Assertions vs. detectable mutants matrices which are used to conduct experiments in RQ 2&3.

Folder : Test Suite Effectiveness by Controlling on Assertion Type
-- Each sub-folder contains a bunch of text files. Each text file contains a list of mutation score of the test suites randomly composed for RQ1. Assertion type of the test suites are mentioned in the file names. JFreeChart contains a sample test suite with assertEquals/Not().
