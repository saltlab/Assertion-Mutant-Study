# Data for Factors Influencing Test Effectiveness
Experimental data collected for paper "Fault Type and Location Influence Measuring Test Suite Effectiveness"

Folder : Assertions vs. detectable mutants matrix.
-- This folder contains the Assertions vs. detectable mutants matrices which are used to conduct experiments in RQ 2&3.

Folder : Test Suite Effectiveness by Controlling on Assertion Type
-- This folder contains a bunch of text files. Each text file contains a list of mutation score of the test suites randomly conposed for RQ1. Subject program and assertion type of the test suites are mentioned in the file names. Folder "Sample Test Suite" contains a sample randomly composed test suite for JFreeChart with 50 randomly selected assertTrue/False().
